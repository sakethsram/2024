Warning lights flickered in the distance, barely noticed.
A warning bell rang softly in the background.
Morning dew glistened with a subtle warning hint.
She whispered a warning secret into the night.
The river flowed peacefully, hiding its warning dangers.
Birds chirped a melodic warning tune at dawn.
Clouds gathered with a stormy warning promise.
The book contained a hidden warning message.
Footsteps echoed a warning rhythm in the hallway.
An ancient warning symbol was etched in the stone.
The dessert came with a surprising warning twist.
A gentle warning reminder hung in the air.
