```JSON
  - Dictionary1
    [
        {"BName": "Python", "BCount": 10},
        {"BName": "C", "BCount": 20},
        {"BName": "R", "BCount": 30},
    ]

  - Dictionary2
    [
        {"BName": "AIML", "BCount": 5},
        {"BName": "R", "BCount": 20},
        {"BName": "Python", "BCount": 10},
    ]
```
2. Caliculate elapsed time between two dates and return in human readable string format
```python
  ptime = "2018-05-15T10:30:07.119045211Z" # past time

  ctime = "2018-05-30T10:30:07.119045211Z" # 15 Days ago
  ctime = "2018-05-15T12:30:07.119045211Z" # 2 Hours ago
  ctime = "2018-05-15T10:55:07.119045211Z" # 25 Minutes ago
  ctime = "2018-05-15T10:30:27.119045211Z" # 20 Seconds ago
```
